To run the flask applications in this demo make sure to turn on the 'virtual env' in this folder by running the following command:

```
source section2/bin/activate
```

The file "create_virtual_env.sh" is how you would create your own virtual environment if you wanted to do so. This folder currently already has a virtual environment

If you wanted to create your own virtual environment in another folder you can run the following lines:

```
virtualenv --python=/usr/local/bin/python3.6 myENV
source myENV/bin/activate
```

The word 'myENV' is the name of this virtual env, but you can call this whatever you want
